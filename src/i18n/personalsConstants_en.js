    description: "To enhance my CSS skills, I decided to take on the 'CSS Zen Garden Challenge.' The task was to style a common webpage using only CSS, without changing the original HTML. It turned out to be a cool project that helped me pick up different CSS tricks. I felt proud of what I achieved, and it was interesting to see how other developers approached the same challenge. Overall, it was a fun way for me to explore and improve my CSS skills.",

While working on it, I picked up some useful web development skills. I started by making the page look good and easy to use. Then, I added features to help users, like messages that pop up if they forgot to fill in all the required info in a form. To wrap it up, I set up a system on the back end to safely store the info people entered into a database. Users would get a quick confirmation message, letting them know their request was successfully sent to the back end.",
